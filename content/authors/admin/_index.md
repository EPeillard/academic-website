I am Associate Professor at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imt-atlantique.fr%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0gKTTRvjYCCF7mL2xVV29q). I am a member of the Inuit team from the [Lab-Sticc](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.labsticc.fr%2Fen%2Findex%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2v4hN11If5KKywCyw7QOo1) lab.

In nov. 2020, I defended my PhD thesis, entitled "Toward a Characterization of Perceptual Biases in Mixed Reality: A Study of Factors Inducing Distance Misperception", conducted in cooperation between [Centrale Nantes](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ec-nantes.fr%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw209FC5ZFHFw4IGxvvYCBcg), the [Inria Hybrid team](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fteam.inria.fr%2Fhybrid%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0-sW690HZejJidIeN7Kr2Z) as well as the [AAU Crenau](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Faau.archi.fr%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2zm9FNYdxd1MNKOEPyMD-c), and supervised by Guillaume Moreau, Ferran Argelaguet and Jean-Marie Normand.

Before this, I obtained an engineering degree at Centrale Nantes in 2017.

My current research interests include human perception issues in Virtual and Augmented Reality, spatial perception in virtual and augmented environments, and more generally, the effect of perceptual biases in mixed environments.
