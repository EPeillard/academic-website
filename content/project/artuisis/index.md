## Abstract
Due to their distributed and autonomous nature, robot swarms have self-adaptation properties that
are very useful, but which make any supervision (visualization and understanding) and control by a
human operator very difficult. The two main scientific issues are helping the operator to understand
and visualize the complex behaviour of the swarm, which emerges from the interactions between
robots; and finding ways to interact with the swarm in an efficient way. This project proposes to use
1) Augmented Reality to help visualize and understand the mechanisms of the swarm's behaviour,
and 2) to design and use a specific tangible interface to represent the spatial dynamics of the swarm,
and influence it in a natural and intuitive way. An evaluation of the contribution of the RA-TUI device
to the users' understanding and usability of the system, within two experimentation framework, is
planned.
