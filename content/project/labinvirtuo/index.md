Project funded by the French National Research Agency, led by Ronan Querrec. 


> The hypothesis we defend is twofold:
>
> 1. the immersion of users in a "Virtual Intelligent Realistic Sensory Environment" (VIRSE) where the body is engaged from a cinematic, gestural and sensory point of view results in:
>    a) an increased recovery of the various procedural, episodic and autobiographical memories which are usually questioned or worked on in the classical framework of oral archive productions. ;
>    b) beyond declarative knowledge, the possibility of capturing gestures and embodied knowledge;
>    c) a better memorization of the proposed knowledge;
> 2. Collaborative Virtual Reality (VR) allows, beyond the classical approaches in SHS, to develop multidisciplinary research methods and innovative mediations with a qualitative and quantitative leap concerning the elicitation and the restitution of knowledge and know-how.
>
> The project is located in the field of knowledge engineering, Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Digital Humanities (DH), on the theme: "Human activity versus history and heritage of industrial and sensory cultural landscapes" as a demonstration.
> Our objectives are to develop and validate: a) virtual laboratories and methods of interdisciplinary research SHS-STIC (IA-RV) from demonstrators of strong historical and heritage interest; b) collaborative methods involving both institutional (museum, etc.) and non-institutional (workers, etc.) actors on the cultural history and digital preservation of industrial trades; c) scenarios located in the EVIRS dedicated to mediation
