abstract: In this paper, we present the design of ten different 3D user interactions
  using passive haptics and embedded in an escape game scenario in which users have
  to escape from a pyramid in a limited time. Our solution is innovative by its modularity,
  allowing interactions with virtual objects using tangible props manipulated either
  directly using the hands and feet or indirectly through a single prop held in the
  hand, in order to perform several interactions with the virtual environment (VE).
  We also propose a navigation technique based on the 'impossible spaces' design,
  allowing users to naturally walk through several overlapping rooms of the VE. All
  together, our different interaction techniques allow the users to solve several
  enigmas built into a challenging scenario inside a pyramid.
