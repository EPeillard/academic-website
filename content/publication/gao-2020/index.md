abstract: "This paper focuses on how virtual objects' shadows as well as differences\
  \ in alignment between virtual and real lighting influence distance perception in\
  \ optical see-through (OST) augmented reality (AR). Four hypotheses are proposed:\
  \ (H1) Participants underestimate distances in OST AR; (H2) Virtual objects' shadows\
  \ improve distance judgment accuracy in OST AR; (H3) Shadows with different realism\
  \ levels have different influence on distance perception in OST AR; (H4) Different\
  \ levels of lighting misalignment between real and virtual lights have different\
  \ influence on distance perception in OST AR scenes. Two experiments were designed\
  \ with an OST head mounted display (HMD), the Microsoft HoloLens. Participants had\
  \ to match the position of a virtual object displayed in the OST-HMD with a real\
  \ target. Distance judgment accuracy was recorded under the different shadows and\
  \ lighting conditions. The results validate hypotheses H2 and H4 but surprisingly\
  \ showed no impact of the shape of virtual shadows on distance judgment accuracy\
  \ thus rejecting hypothesis H3. Regarding hypothesis H1, we detected a trend toward\
  \ underestimation; given the high variance of the data, more experiments are needed\
  \ to confirm this result. Moreover, the study also reveals that perceived distance\
  \ errors and completion time of trials increase along with targets' distance."
