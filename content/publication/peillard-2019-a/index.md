abstract: 'While perceptual biases have been widely investigated in Virtual Reality
  (VR), very few studies have considered the challenging environment of Optical See-through
  Augmented Reality (OST-AR). Moreover, regarding distance perception, existing works
  mainly focus on the assessment of egocentric distance perception, i.e. distance
  between the observer and a real or a virtual object. In this paper, we study exocentric
  distance perception in AR, hereby considered as the distance between two objects,
  none of them being directly linked to the user. We report a user study (n=29) aiming
  at estimating distances between two objects lying in a frontoparallel plane at 2.1m
  from the observer (i.e. in the medium-field perceptual space). Four conditions were
  tested in our study: real objects on the left and on the right of the participant
  (called real-real), virtual objects on both sides (virtual-virtual), a real object
  on the left and a virtual one on the right (real-virtual) and finally a virtual
  object on the left and a real object on the right (virtual-real). Participants had
  to reproduce the distance between the objects by spreading two real identical objects
  presented in front of them. The main findings of this study are the overestimation
  (20%) of exocentric distances for all tested conditions. Surprisingly, the real-real
  condition was significantly more overestimated (by about 4%, p=.0166) compared to
  the virtual-virtual condition, i.e. participants obtained better estimates of the
  exocentric distance for the virtual-virtual condition. Finally, for the virtual-real/real-virtual
  conditions, the analysis showed a non-symmetrical behavior, which suggests that
  the relationship between real and virtual objects with respect to the user might
  be affected by other external factors. Considered together, these unexpected results
  illustrate the need for additional experiments to better understand the perceptual
  phenomena involved in exocentric distance perception with real and virtual objects.'
