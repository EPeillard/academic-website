abstract: "The topic of distance perception has been widely investigated in Virtual\
  \ Reality (VR). However, the vast majority of previous workmainly focused on distance\
  \ perception of objects placed in frontof the observer. Then, what happens when\
  \ the observer looks onthe side? In this paper, we study differences in distance\
  \ estimationwhen comparing objects placed in front of the observer with objectsplaced\
  \ on his side. Through a series of four experiments (n=85),we assessed participants'\
  \ distance estimation and ruled out poten-tial biases. In particular, we considered\
  \ the placement of visualstimuli in the field of view, users' exploration behavior\
  \ as well asthe presence of depth cues. For all experiments a two-alternativeforced\
  \ choice (2AFC) standardized psychophysical protocol wasemployed, in which the main\
  \ task was to determine the stimuli thatseemed to be the farthest one. In summary,\
  \ our results showed thatthe orientation of virtual stimuli with respect to the\
  \ user introducesa distance perception bias: objects placed on the sides are system-atically\
  \ perceived farther away than objects in front. In addition,we could observe that\
  \ this bias increases along with the angle, andappears to be independent of both\
  \ the position of the object in thefield of view as well as the quality of the virtual\
  \ scene. This worksheds a new light on one of the specificities of VR environmentsregarding\
  \ the wider subject of visual space theory. Our study pavesthe way for future experiments\
  \ evaluating the anisotropy of distanceperception in real and virtual environments."
