abstract: "Commonly used Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) in Augmented Reality (AR), namely\
  \ Optical See-Through (OST) displays, suffer from a main drawback: their focal lenses\
  \ can only provide a fixed focal distance. Such a limitation is suspected to be\
  \ one of the main factors for distance misperception in AR. In this paper, we studied\
  \ the use of an emerging new kind of AR display to tackle such perception issues:\
  \ Retinal Projection Displays (RPDs). With RPDs, virtual images have no focal distance\
  \ and the AR content is always in focus. We conducted the first reported experiment\
  \ evaluating egocentric distance perception of observers using Retinal Projection\
  \ Displays. We compared the precision and accuracy of the depth estimation between\
  \ real and virtual targets, displayed by either OST HMDs or RPDs. Interestingly,\
  \ our results show that RPDs provide depth estimates in AR closer to real ones compared\
  \ to OST HMDs. Indeed, the use of an OST device was found to lead to an overestimation\
  \ of the perceived distance by 16%, whereas the distance overestimation bias dropped\
  \ to 4% with RPDs. Besides, the task was reported with the same level of difficulty\
  \ and no difference in precision. As such, our results shed the first light on retinal\
  \ projection displays' benefits in terms of user's perception in Augmented Reality,\
  \ suggesting that RPD is a promising technology for AR applications in which an\
  \ accurate distance perception is required."
