abstract: 'Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, these words as well
  as their applications are gradually becoming common usage. However, the reality
  proposed by these technologies is not identical to our regular reality. This work
  aims to highlight some perceptual biases in Mixed Reality. First we study a perceptual
  bias linked to the observer: the anisotropy of the egocentric distances perception
  in virtual reality. In a second part, we study the exocentric perception of distances
  in Augmented Reality (AR). Indeed the underestimation of egocentric distances is
  a phenomenon frequently observed and it is therefore interesting to consider its
  potential transfer to the exocentric perception. Then we further study other potential
  biases in AR by focusing in particular on evaluating the impact of depth cues on
  the perception of distances. In particular, we investigate in this chapter the effect
  of two depth cues in AR: the impact of the position and shape of shadows on distance
  perception, and then the influence of accommodation on distance perception using
  a specific display technology: retinal projection devices. Finally, we discuss the
  potential impact of interaction techniques on distance perception and propose a
  protocol to evaluate the effect of certain interactions on distance perception in
  AR, in order to perhaps bring it closer to real perception.'
